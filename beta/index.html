    <h1 id="about">About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Thanks for visiting my website! My name is Pratik, and I am an Arizona native. Born and raised in the
      Chandler/Gilbert area, I graduated from Arizona State University with my Bachelor's in Computer Science in May
      2020 and my Master's in Computer Science in May 2021. This site is a work in progress, so if you have any questions
      or comments, please <a href="mailto:pratik@pratikpanda.dev">feel free to reach out</a>!
    </p>

      <img class="aboutme-img" src="./images/lionsclub.png" alt="Lions Club Logo" />
      <p class="aboutme-content">
        In my free time, I volunteer with the <a href="https://e-clubhouse.org/sites/chandleraz/index.php">Chandler Lions
        Club</a>, helping to give back to the community I grew up in. Catch me taking free Santa Pictures in downtown
        Chandler, leading a costume parade of Chandler children for Halloween, or zooming around Snedigar Park in a golf
        cart providing snacks and drinks to the soccer and baseball children (and their parents, of course!). Additionally,
        I am the Leos Advisor/Liasion for the Hamilton High School Leos Club, helping our teenagers give back to their
        community.

        I am also a technical advisor for the <a href="https://devilfishrobotics.com/">DevilFish Robotics</a> club at
        Arizona State University. This club builds semi- and fully- autonomous underwater vehicles to compete in
        international competitions like <a href="https://robosub.org/">RoboSub</a> or
        <a href="https://materovcompetition.org/">MATE</a>. For most of these students, this is their first foray into
        robotics, and their first experience into an application-based project. As someone who went through that same
        experience when I was in this club at ASU (under the name NASA Space Grant Robotics), I help guide these students
        so that they can be the most successful versions of themselves.

      At Intel, I work within Supply Chain on Master Production Scheduling (MPS) software. Primarily, I work on the
      reporting capabilities for OneMPS (a long-range supply chain planning solution) and FSCO (an immediate-term factory
      scheduling solution).
