Catch me taking free Santa Pictures in downtown Chandler, leading a costume parade of Chandler children for Halloween, or zooming around Snedigar Park in a golf cart providing snacks and drinks to the soccer and baseball children (and their parents, of course!). Additionally, I am the Leos Advisor/Liasion for the Hamilton High School Leos Club, helping our teenagers give back to their community.",

        "description": "I am also a technical advisor for the <a href=\"https://devilfishrobotics.com/\">DevilFish Robotics</a> club at Arizona State University. This club builds semi- and fully- autonomous underwater vehicles to compete in international competitions like <a href=\"https://robosub.org/\">RoboSub</a> or <a href=\"https://materovcompetition.org/\">MATE</a>. For most of these students, this is their first foray into robotics, and their first experience into an application-based project. As someone who went through that same experience when I was in this club at ASU (under the name NASA Space Grant Robotics), I help guide these students so that they can be the most successful versions of themselves.",
