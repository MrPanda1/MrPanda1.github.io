# Personal Website
This is the repository for my personal website. It is a static website built
using native HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks used).

To run this site locally in debug mode, use the following command:
```bash
pip install httpwatcher

httpwatcher
```

This website is automatically deployed to both
[MrPanda1.github.io](https://MrPanda1.github.io) (via GitHub Pages) and
[pratikpanda.dev](https://pratikpanda.dev) (via Netlify) on every push to
`master`.
